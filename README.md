Xcode for mac os

Get File .cpp file

go to terminal of computer 
compile and run

Read the text, it is pretty well thought out so that the user will have an easy time using our program.

download a compiler ex: xcode for mac OS
launch CPP file
run on IDE
Interact with console and react to the text on that print out of console, and continue until completed.

Ex: choose 1,2, or 3.  1 will allow the user to input perishable stock, 2 will allow the user to input non perishable stock, 3 
will allow the user to input both perishable and non poerishable stock.

whatever your choice you will be asked how many items you want to enter, then you will be asked to enter the name of the item, you will
then be asked to enter the price of the item, then you will be asked how many items that are in stock.
what will be outputed is the name,price,quantity, and the overall worth of stock on hand. the overall worth is calculated based on the multiplication
of stock and price.
then this will be repeated until you have entered the amount of items that you entered at step two of the program.
